# CryptoCryptography

*Overview*

The purpose of this project is to gain experience with emerging technologies related to cybersecurity, cryptocurrency and my own interest.
The project integrates blockchain technology with cryptographic principles to verify Bitcoin wallet balances, generate NFT metada, and verify the information using myself as the certificate authority. 

*Features*

**Wallet Verification**: Verifies a cryptocurrency wallet balance.

**NFT Metadata Generation**: Creates and stores NFT metadata.

**QR Code Linking**: Generates a scannable QR code that links to the NFT.

**ECDSA Cryptographic Signature**: Uses cryptographic theory to generate public and private keys based on the user information.
