# CryptoCryptography

*Overview*

The purpose of this project is to gain experience with emerging technologies related to cybersecurity, cryptocurrency and my own interest.
The project integrates blockchain technology with cryptographic principles to verify Bitcoin wallet balances, generate NFT metadata, and verify the information using myself as the certificate authority.
<br />
<br />

*Features*

**Wallet Verification**: Verifies a cryptocurrency wallet balance.

**NFT Metadata Generation**: Creates and stores NFT metadata.

**QR Code Linking**: Generates a scannable QR code that links to the NFT.

**ECDSA Cryptographic Signature**: Uses cryptographic theory to generate public and private keys based on the user information.
<br />
<br />

*Milestones*

**Milestone 1: Basic User I/O**  
Basic project outline with command line interface to begin. The user will be asked to create an account. Then, the user will be asked to provide their public cryptocurrency wallet address. The app will use an API to determine the current balance of the wallet. The user data will be backed up to a databases. Finally, a basic UI will be created to make the experience more user friendly.

**Milestone 2: NFT Creation**  
From the wallet provided, the application will mint a unique NFT and pass ownership to the bearer of the cryptocurrency wallet. A QR code is then generated that directly links to display the NFT and corresponding metadata.  

**Milestone 3: Crypographic Signing**  
I will be the acting certificate authority for all transactions and provide the wallet bearer with a verifiable public key which confirms the wallet balance at the time of minting.
